# Bike Sales Analysis
In this data analysis project we will work with spreadsheets, We will be using a dataset that contains information about a fictional survey taken by more than a thousand people, by using spreadsheets were are going to be able to handle this data through a cleaning process and be able to create a functional dashboard. Our main objective is to understand what type of customer is purchasing bikes, by comparing the income per purchase by gender, age, and commute distance.


### Objectives
1. Data cleaning: remove duplicates, blanks, and fix outliers from the dataset, add or transform columns to add consistency to the data.
2. Data analysis: use pivot tables to obtain the results needed for the analysis for e.g: the average income, commute distance by customer.
3. Data visualization: Create a functional dashboard with the appropriate graphs to display the results, add slicer to filter to have a better understanding of the data, e.g: education level, region, etc.
